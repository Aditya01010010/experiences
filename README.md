## About ##
experiences is a fully responsive website aimed at overcoming boredom at home during the lockdown. I've tried to create a mini vacation experience with an attempt at an aesthetic website coupled with interesting features like a Text-to-Speech module that helps you learn how to pronounce words in Spanish.
